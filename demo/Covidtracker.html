Preliminary analysis indicates that the second wave has been more geographically clustered so far. To cope with the rising numbers, state governments across the country are striving to ensure the availability of sufficient hospital beds, both ICU and non-ICU for COVID management along with increased capacity in COVID Care Centres (CCCs), across the public and private sector.</h3></p>
